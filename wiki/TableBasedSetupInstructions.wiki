==Step 6==
  * Header Row Count represents which row the "Header Row" or describer row is located. This row will then be skipped.
  * From the drop down, select which date format you're using.
  #1 If date/time is in one column, and represented something like: "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" choose "String Format"
  #2 If date/time is represented over multiple columns, choose "year, month, day, time"
  * Then press DateTime Settings to configure

==Step 7==
  * If String Format, select the index of the date time column (remember, all indexes are zero indexed)
  * If the format is different than the one specified, this can be changed here as well

  * If year, month, day, time, select the indexes that each field lies in (zero indexed).

==Step 9==
  * If the column should not be parsed, leave as ignore field and skip to step 12.
  * Date/time columns can be left as ignored, as they're accounted for in steps 6 and 7. But these rows must still be accounted for with an ignore field.
  * If column should be parsed, select it and press Edit.

==Step 14== 
  * To save these configurations for later use, select File, then either "Save Selected Chain" or "Save All Chains"
  * Your current configuration will save and load itself on exit and startup on Ziggy, but saving it manually can then add the ability to send the chain to a different computer, and protect the chain from a lost or damaged configuration file.

===Errors===
  * If you receive a malformed row error, make sure you have exactly the same number of columns you're trying to parse as exist in the file (including date/time format columns).
